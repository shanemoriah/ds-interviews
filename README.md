# ds-interview

Your challenge is to download the attached data file and generate a model that can be used to predict the repayment of the loan (or risk of default).  

The file contains historical personal loan data from an online lending platform. You can find the data dictionary explaining the columns as an spreadsheet in this directory as well.  The target/label for the model should be the "loan_status" column where "FULLY_PAID" means a successful repayment.

__For your submission, please provide:__
1) The code you used to prepare the data as well as the code used for scoring a new record.
2) An evaluation of your model performance along with a short (1 paragraph) explanation geared to a non-data-scientist of how you analyzed your model and what any reported performance metrics mean.
3) A short (1-2 paragraph) explanation of your process (what techniques were considered? which did you choose and why? did you do anything special to prepare the data?)
4) A short explanation (1 paragraph) of anything you wish you could fix up or try if you had more time.
